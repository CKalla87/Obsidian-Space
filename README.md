# Obsidian Space

Obsidian Space is a reverb plugin designed to create depth, atmosphere, and vast spatial environments. It focuses on dark, smooth tails and evolving space rather than pristine realism.

Obsidian Space is an open-source project built for producers and developers who enjoy shaping environments as an instrument.

## Features

- Reverb processing focused on depth and atmosphere
- Smooth, dark reverb tails with evolving character
- Designed for subtle ambience or massive space
- Simple controls with wide creative range
- Lightweight and responsive

Obsidian Space is not about realistic rooms. It is about presence and scale.

## Philosophy

Obsidian Space was built around one idea:

Space shapes emotion.

Reverb can place sound in a room, or it can place it somewhere unreal. Obsidian Space lives in that second world, where distance, size, and decay become part of the performance.

If it feels too small, open it up.  
If it feels too clean, let it darken.

## Final Note

Obsidian Space is meant to feel deep and endless.

Let tails overlap.
Let decay breathe.
Let sound disappear into the dark.
